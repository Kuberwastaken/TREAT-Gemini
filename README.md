I was tired of getting grossed out watching unexpected scenes in movies and TV and losing my appetite, that's why I created TREAT.

The goal of this project is to empower viewers by forewarning them about potential triggers in the content they watch, making the viewing experience more enjoyable, inclusive, and appropriate for everyone.

TREAT is a web application that uses natural language processing to analyze movie and TV show scripts, identifying potential triggers to help viewers make informed choices.

   python3 -m venv treat-gemini
   ```

2. Activate the Virtual Environment:

   ```bash
   source treat-env/bin/activate   # On Unix or MacOS
   treat-env\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. Install Dependencies:

   Navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Usage
1. **Start the Flask Server:**

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

2. **Open Your Browser:** 

   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the TREAT web interface.

3. **Analyze Scripts:**

   You can manually enter a script in the provided text area and click "Analyze Script."

## File Descriptions
- **app.py:** The main Flask application file that handles routing.

- **app/routes.py:** Contains the Flask routes for handling script uploads.

- **app/model.py:** Includes the script analysis functions using the Llama-3.2-1B model.

- **templates/index.html:** The main HTML file for the web interface.

- **static/css/style.css:** Custom CSS for styling the web interface.

- **static/js/app.js:** JavaScript for handling client-side interactions.

## Types of Triggers Detected
The TREAT application focuses on identifying a variety of potential triggers in scripts, including but not limited to:

- **Violence:** Scenes of physical aggression or harm.

- **Self-Harm:** Depictions of self-inflicted injury.

- **Death:** Depictions of death or dying characters.

- **Sexual Content:** Any depiction or mention of sexual activity, intimacy, or behavior.

- **Sexual Abuse:** Instances of sexual violence or exploitation.

- **Gun Use:** Depictions of firearms and their usage.

- **Gore:** Graphic depiction of injury, blood, or dismemberment.

- **Vomit:** Depictions of vomiting or nausea-inducing content.

- **Mental Health Issues:** Depictions of mental health struggles, including anxiety, depression, or disorders.

- **Animal Cruelty:** Depictions of harm or abuse towards animals.

These categories help address a very real-world problem by forewarning viewers about potentially distressing content, enhancing their viewing experience.

Adding new categories is as simple as specifying a new category under model.py and utils.py (no detailed prompts needed as it's a deep reasoning model)
